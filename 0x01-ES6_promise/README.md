Promises in JavaScript
A promise is a special JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is a way to handle asynchronous code more elegantly and avoid callback hell.

Key Concepts

1. States
   Pending: The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.

Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
